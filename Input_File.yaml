Global_Scint_Lengths: G
	Comments:  
		This defines the x-length and y-length of the scintillator cells.  The information is in centimeters
		This will be used to define the hexogonal shape of the scintillator cell(s), air gaps, MPPC(s) 
		and Collimator(s).  
	x-length: 3.72
	y-length: 3.22

Scintillator: Scint1
	Comments:
		Use this block to define each Scintillator cell needed.  Inputs to define this is the top and bottom elevation,
		The vertex (x and y points) and the spherical data if the cell is intersected by one (Don't include Sphere block
		if Sphere is not included).  Also, included is the meshing options for the x,y direction and the z direction.
		All values are in centimeters.
	z_bot: 0.0
	z_top: 0.3
	x_vertex: 0.0
	y_vertex: 0.0
	xy_mesh_numb: 2
	z_mesh_numb: 5
	Sphere: Intersect1
		Comments:
			Use this block only if an intersection occurs.  This block always is defined in the Scintillator block. The values 
			needed to define this block is the thickness the sphere penetrates the scintillator cell, whether it intersects the 
			top of bottom of the cell, the vertex (x and y points) of the sphere, and the radius of the sphere.

		Intersection_Location: Bot
		x_vertex: 0.0
		y_vertex: 0.0
		radius: 1.2

MPPC: MPPC1
	Comments:  
		This defines the bottom and top elevations of the MPPC, the vertex (x and y points), x-length of MPCC, y-length of
		MPCC and the number of meshes in the xy direction and the z direction.

AirGap: AirGap1
	Comments:
		This defines the air gap between the Scintillator cell and the collimator.  This block defines the bottom elevation
		and top elevation.
	z_bot: 0.3
	z_top: 0.64

AirGap: AirGap2
	Comments:
		This defines the air gap above the collimator.  This block defines the bottom elevation and top elevation.
	z_bot: 1.29
	z_top: 2.5

Collimator: Cmator1
	Comments:
		This defines the starting and ending elevation of the collimator.  This models solid copper. With the exception
		of one area, which is where the source particle exits.  This is a cylindrical shape made of 'air' the needed inputs are 
		x and y vertex and the radius
